# NeetCode 250 - Additional 100 Solutions in C++

This repository contains my solutions to the problems that are in [NeetCode 250](https://neetcode.io/practice) but not in NeetCode 150, implemented in C++. These additional 100 problems cover essential algorithms and data structures frequently asked in technical interviews.

For solutions to the original NeetCode 150 problems, please refer to my previous repository: [NeetCode 150](https://github.com/prashkrans/neetcode_150).

## Timeline

This project was started on **May 2, 2025** and is still in progress.

## About NeetCode 250

NeetCode 250 extends the original NeetCode 150 list with an additional 100 problems. This repository focuses specifically on these extra 100 problems that aren't part of the NeetCode 150. Like the original list, these problems are categorized by data structure/algorithm and difficulty level, helping to build a strong foundation in:

1. Arrays & Hashing
2. Two Pointers
3. Sliding Window
4. Stack
5. Binary Search
6. Linked List
7. Trees
8. Tries
9. Heap / Priority Queue
10. Backtracking
11. Graphs
12. Dynamic Programming
13. Greedy
14. Intervals
15. Math & Geometry
16. Bit Manipulation

## Repository Structure

## How to Use

Each solution file is named after the problem and includes:
- The **NeetCode** and **LeetCode** problem numbers  
- A step-by-step explanation of the approach  
- Both my custom solution and the optimal solution (where applicable)  
- **Inline comments** on the right side explaining key parts of the code  
- **Time** and **space** complexity analysis  
- Alternative or multiple approaches (where applicable)  
- Only the `Solution` class and the relevant function implementation (no driver code or test cases)  
- All solutions have been tested
