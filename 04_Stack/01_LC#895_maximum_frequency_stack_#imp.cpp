/* LC#895. Maximum Frequency Stack

Three components:
1. map of elements and their frequencies
2. map of frequencies and stacks
3. max frequency variable that may or may not increase(or, decrease) with each push(or, pop)

Note:
- stacks could either be an unordered_map of stacks or a vector of stacks
- incase of a vector of stacks, index of stack = freq - 1 not freq
*/

/**
 * Your FreqStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * FreqStack* obj = new FreqStack();
 * obj->push(val);
 * int param_2 = obj->pop();
 */

/*
### Approach: Hash Maps with Frequency-Based Stacks
1. Use a frequency map to keep count of how many times each number has been pushed into
the stack, allowing fast updates.
2. Use another map that maps each frequency to a stack that holds all numbers with that
exact frequency, preserving order.
3. When pushing, increment the valueâ€™s frequency and push it onto the corresponding stack
based on updated frequency.
4. Track the current highest frequency so we can always access the most frequent element
in constant time during popping.
5. When popping, retrieve the top element from the stack corresponding to max frequency,
decrement its frequency, and return it.
6. If a stack at max frequency becomes empty, reduce maxFreq to the next available frequency
that has elements.
7. This setup ensures both push and pop operations happen in O(1) time and use O(N) space
for the underlying structures.

// Time Complexity (pop):  O(1)                                         // Each pop is constant due to hash map and stack usage
// Space Complexity:      O(N)                                          // Space used for storing frequency map and grouped stacks
